ProxNest: Proximal nested sampling for high-dimensional Bayesian inference
=================================================================================================================

This is a very loose framework for people to start python projects from. To get up and running, go through the code carefully replacing ``Project-name`` with your 
desired project name (check all documents!), don't forget to change the directory project_name as well! You will also need to update the links in all badges!
